iOS 7 拖动所有**.swift**到xcode工程中。

If you want to compile for iOS 7:

1. Drag the code itself (.swift files) to your project. As sadly, Swift currently does not support compiling Frameworks for iOS 7.
1. Make sure that the files are added to the Target membership.
1. When using Swift in an ObjC project:
    a. You need to import your Bridging Header. Usually it is "YourProject-Swift.h", so in ChartsDemo it's "ChartsDemo-Swift.h". Do not try to actually include "ChartsDemo-Swift.h" in your project :-)
    a. Under "Build Options", mark "Embedded Content Contains Swift Code"

## Documentation
---

Currently there's no need for documentation for the iOS version, as the API is 95% the same as on Android.

You can read the official [MPAndroidChart](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart) documentation here: [Wiki](https://github.com/PhilJay/MPAndroidChart/wiki)

Or you can see the [ChartsDemo](https://github.com/danielgindi/ios-charts/tree/master/ChartsDemo) project and learn the how-tos from it.
