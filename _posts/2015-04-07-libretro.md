## What is Libretro?
---

Libretro is a simple but powerful developement interface that allows for the easy creation of emulators, games and multimedia applications that can plug stright into any libretro-compatible frontend. This development interface is open to others so that they can run these pluggable emulator and game cores also in their own programs or devices. 

### What is possible with libretro?

* Play games (retro and more current ones)
* Watch movies (through the ffmpeg libretro core)
* Other stuff (augmented reality, etc) (experimental test cores that showcase camera and location API support)

With libretro, you can make cross-platform applications that can use rich features such as OpenGL, cross-platform camera support, location support, and more in the future.

## What is RetroArch?
---

RetroArch is the official reference frontend for the libretro API.

## What is it most commonly used for?
---

RetroArch can be many things to many persons. However, it is currently used by most as a modular multi-system game/emulator system. It suits that usecase well since it has been designed to be fast, lightweight, and portable. It has fetures few other dedicated games / emulators have, such as:

* Real-time rewinding
* Multi-pass shaders (up to 8-pass)
* Game aware shading
* Remote networked sound support
* A build-in GUI/OSD system

And more...

## What platforms does it support?
---

RetroArch sets the standard on cross-platform portability right now.

* Linux (x86 and x86_64)
* Windows (32bit/64bit)
* Mac OSX (Intel)
* Playstation 3 (PS3 SDK)
* Playstation Portable (PSP)[WIP]
* Xbox 1 (XDK)
* Xbox 360 (XeXDK/Libxenon)
* Gamecube
* Wii
* Raspberry Pi
* OpenPandora
* Android
* Blackberry (10/Playbook)
* iOS

## What web platforms does it support?
---

Far be it for us to just limit ourselves to physical platforms - we also go beyond that:

* Javascript (ASM.js - Enscripten)

Check out a handful of demos here - [RetroArch Emscripten][]. Note - best results are obtained by using Firefox Nightly. It can mean the difference between a core running at fullspeed or not depending on your hardware/OS.
